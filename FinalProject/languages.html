                <p>Understanding the different languages and how they cooperate is key to making webpages efficient and user friendly. Learning them takes practice, and as 
                much material as there is to read, the easiest way to learn it all is to get hands on experience and code.

                <p>Everything I have learned this semester has greatly furthered my understanding of coding, how computers work, and the different languages that there are to learn 
                about. I have worked hard for the progress that I have made this semester and cannot wait to see how much more my knowledge will grow and where my career will go. 
                We are all familiar with the struggle of continuing when we cannot see what is ahead of us, so I am grateful for this opportunity to reflect on what I have learned 
                to propel me forward.
